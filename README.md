 Suppose that we have three fare dice and x is a discrete random variable which is the possible
outcome of each die. So, x can take on values in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Also suppose that y is a discrete
random variable which is the sum of these three dice. So, y can take on values in {3,4,5,. . . , 18}.


GroupSim13: Suppose that we repeat the experiment of rolling the dice for N times. Generate the
outcomes for N = 100 trials of rolling these three dice in MATLAB and save the observed
values in the vectors x1, x2 and x3. Then, save the sum of the three dice in vector y.

GroupSim14: Write a MATLAB code to count the number of times each number is observed in x1, x2,
and x3, and save them in vectors H1, H2, and H3, respectively (for example, if x1 = 3 is
observed 120 times, then H1(3) = 120). Then plot the vectors H1, H2, and H2
