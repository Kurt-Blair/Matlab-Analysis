Suppose that we have three fare dice and x is a discrete random variable which is the possible outcome of each die. So, x can take on values in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Also suppose that y is a discrete random variable which is the sum of these three dice. So, y can take on values in {3,4,5,. . . , 18}.

GroupSim14: Suppose that we repeat the experiment of rolling the dice for N times. Generate the outcomes for N = 100 trials of rolling these three dice in MATLAB and save the observed values in the vectors x1, x2 and x3. Then, save the sum of the three dice in vector y
